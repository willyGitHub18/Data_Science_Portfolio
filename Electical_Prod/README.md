# Electrical Annual Production - Data Exploration

In this project, we will be using on of **[ENEDIS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enedis)** open dataset, available on its [Open Data](https://data.enedis.fr/pages/accueil/?id=init) platform. 
The chosen dataset is the one regarding [annual electrical production by departments](https://data.enedis.fr/explore/dataset/production-electrique-par-filiere-a-la-maille-departement/information/?sort=annee), the dataset has already been cleaned and so our main objective will be to try to see if we could perform some more cleaning to better fit the data to our secondary objective : performing a overall exploration of the dataset.  

One remark should be made before starting. What is meant by "production" here refers to the electricity produced by users of the infrastructure (with *hydrolic power*, *wind turbines*, *solar panels*, ...), it is not the electricity produced by electricity providers (see [here](https://www.enedis.fr/produire-de-lelectricite-en-bt-36-kva-hta#onglet-preparation-du-projet) for more on the subject).
