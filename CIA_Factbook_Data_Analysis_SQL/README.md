# CIA World Factbook - Basic Exploratory Analysis Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

    population — the global population.
    population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
    area — the total land and water area.

In this guided project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database (available in the project folder).
