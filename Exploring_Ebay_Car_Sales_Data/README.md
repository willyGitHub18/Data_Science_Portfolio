# Cleaning and Exploring eBay Cars Sales Data

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.  
    
The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user *orgesleka* but unfortunately the original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data\).    
A few modifications from the original dataset were made :   
* Sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment
* Dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)    

The aim of this project is to :     
* **Clean the data**
* **Perform a basic analyze**
